 WAT_economy:0 "Call the Keepers!"
 WAT_economy_desc:0 "As the New Year dawns, it is time to once again call the Annual Convention of the Keepers, where Keepers of the seven Watertowns gather in to discuss issues and resolve conflicts between them. Despite the name, the Convention does not occur yearly, and many Keepers have come and gone without ever seeing their counterparts. Not these ones."

 WAT_first_keeper_convention:0 "Woes of Industry"
 WAT_first_keeper_convention_desc:0 "The topic of this year's Convention is industrialization. It is, unfortunately, a controvertial topic in the Watertowns. The Keeper of Floodgate and his allies seek to forcibly bring the towns into the modern day, while the Keeper of Freshwater and the clergy strive to ensure the status quo. Keeper Eathlin has been trying to forge a middle ground between the two, with limited success. It is to be seen if this issue can be resolved for the congress..."

 #Decisions

Each of the seven Watertowns is entitled to one Keeper to represent them in the Council, and each of them is elected by a complete village assembly. Most prominent among them is [WAT.GetLeader], first among equals.\n\nDrawing support from the River merchants residing in Floodgate and the idealists from Snowdin who have been intoxicated on the idea of a powerful, prosperous Watertowns, the modernist faction wields great influence. They, after all, have been the driver of the recent uptick in economic and industrial activity in the Watertowns. \nThe popularity of the §RModernist faction§! is §Y[?WAT.party_popularity@neutrality|%0]§!\n\nAlthough Keeper Eathlin and her moderates are not the most popular faction in the Watertowns, she is respected by all for her attempts at reconciliation and moderation. She hasn't had much success, but her status as first among equals and the Keeper of Watertown, the largest settlement in the area, give her much credibility. \nThe popularity of the §GModerate faction§! is §Y[?WAT.party_popularity@democratic|%0]§!\n\nRallying around Keeper Malcolm of Freshwater Cavern, the traditionalists seek to uphold the status quo. The traditionalists seek to preserve the way of life that the ponies of the Watertowns have lived with for centuries. They see the Council of Keepers as the most desirable form of government and want to keep the decentralized government of the Watertowns intact. \nThe popularity of the §gTraditionalist faction§! is §Y[?WAT.party_popularity@communism|%0]§!\n\n"

 WAT_industrialization1_desc:0 "The Watertowns, located at the edge of nobody cares, has always lived in blissful isolation from the rest of the world. It was only recently, with Griffon incursions from the west, and with River merchants enroaching from the southeast did the ponies of the Watertowns finally understand the world they lived in.

 WAT_economy.01.t:0 "The Keepers of Watertowns"
 WAT_economy.01.d:0 "The seven keepers rarely agree on anything, and that is not a big surprise. Conditions in different towns varies greatly as one travels, so it should be expected that they share different views. This is normally not a problem, as the Keepers rarely meet and petty disputes are usually solved pony-to-pony, without a need for the village councils or the Keepers to intervene. But not all points of contention can be solved that way, and while most issues are microscopic in scale, foreign policy and the economy are certainly not.\n\nSuch is the importance of industrialization, that many village delegates have found it fit to occupy their Keeper's precious time with why should modernize or not. This has indirectly taken away time that could have been used to solve problems or try to find a solution to the debate, but every villager has the right to state their opinion to their local Keeper. It is not like they can just ignore traditions dating back to when the area was first settled, after all. Even the Keepers of Oiltown and Floodgate adhere, although not for long...\n\nIn any case, the disturbances to normal life in the Watertowns has forced Keeper Eathlin to call for the Keepers to convene, which has rarely happened in the past. The age-old assembly hall in Watertown will have to be dusted clean and prepared, and couriers will have to brave the journeys between towns to deliver the news of the event, and only then can a civil discussion begin. Let us hope that civil blood will not make civil hands unclean..."

 #Leader/General Descriptions
 EATHLIN_COMMUNISM_DESC:0 "You would think that given her status as first among equals, Keeper Eathlin was descended from of the most prestigious families, perhaps even a descendant of one of the Watertowns' most revered heroes. Such a lineage does not exist. Indeed, in all of the Watertowns, elite and noble families do not exist, save for those among the River merchants in Floodgate. This is a key feature of Watertowner society: a distinct lack of stratification, and a strong emphasis on personal ability and charm. This, after, is how Keeper Eathlin rose from being a humble cowherd to Keeper of her hometown, Watertown.\n\nShe strongly disawovs the almost-partisan struggle between the modernists and the traditionalists, rather opting for the middle ground in between the two opposing sides."
