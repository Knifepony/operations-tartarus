    HLQ_made_mighty:0 "Made Mighty"
    HLQ_made_mighty_desc:0 "Given time and dedication, anyone has the potential to learn the true way of life- that is our way, the Griffons' way! It is so superior that all must be shown down the path... even ponies. As such, we must destroy their weak culture to preserve stability and unity in our lands!"

    HLQ_made_mighty_2_desc:0 "Given time and dedication, anyone has the potential to learn the true way of life- that is our way, the Griffons' way!

    HLQ_born_mighty_desc:0 "This continent is named Griffonia for a reason. We shall ensure that this name is held as accurate and no longer sullied by the continued presence of undesirables like ponies, who corrupt and degrade the prestige of the land of Griffons!"
    HLQ_black_cloaks_in_council:0 "The Reformisten in the Council"
    HLQ_black_cloaks_in_council_desc:0 "With his newly gained power, Wingfried has arranged many high-ranking members of his movement to be put into the Council. They are unlikely to oppose his policies now, leaving him free to do whatever he has in mind for our nation."
    HLQ_militarize_police:0 "Militarise the Police"
    HLQ_militarize_police_desc:0 "Our police force has begun recruiting ponies who have forfeited their weak culture for the superior Griffon Way. This will allow us to secure a stronger grip on the dissidents and shut down any hardliners in the process. Wingfried has proposed to militarise them by turning them into paramilitary groups in which any fanatic teen can apply. This will not only show the youth the strength of the Reformisten ideology and the New Hellquill, but will also keep pressure on our domestic enemies."
    HLQ_geheimdienst:0 "Organise the Geheimdienst"
    HLQ_geheimdienst_desc:0 "In order to keep a watchful eye on our citizens and our neighbours, our Secret Service shall provide us with valuable information. You have to be on the lookout, these days, after all..."

    HLQ_a_bullet_for_the_hardliners_desc:0 "Some members of the Reformisten seem to actually believe that non-griffons cannot be taught the Griffon Way and by extension cannot be made into mighty Griffonians.

    HLQ_group_936_desc:0 "After the successful integration of ponies into Griffonian culture, we- and especially our scientists- have come to realize that there is much to gain by experimenting with the natural magic of ponykind.

    HLQ_kulturkampf:0 "Kulturkampf"
    HLQ_kulturkampf_desc:0 "The conquest of eastern lands means that we will occupy great swaths of land crippled by pony culture.

    HLQ_junkerschulen:0 "Junkerschulen"
    HLQ_junkerschulen_desc:0 "The Sturm brigades are the most elite part of our troops, and yet they lack specialised training.

    HLQ_host_attack:0 "Stabilize The Hosts"
    HLQ_host_attack_desc:0 "The Cossack Griffons are known to be excellent warriors, but this talent for warfare seems to be wasted on petty things like raiding and minor disputes. The lords of the Host are always engaged in a vicious cycle of pillaging their neighbors and fighting amongst themselves, not having any ambitions or purpose beyond this cycle. It is time for us to give them a greater purpose, whether they like it or not."

    HLQ_gla_attack:0 "Secure Prywhen"

Under the tyrannical Comrade-General, who drove the nation into a civil war lasting over 4 years, the people's suffering has been ignored by the Reds, refusing to see flaws in their ideology and their attempts in making the rotten thing 'pure'.
