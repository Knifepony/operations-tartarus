SRS_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "In 1002, Asper Sickleclaw encouraged an ultimately successful project to convert the stockpiles of Vorderlader Model 70 muzzle-loader rifles into breech-loading rifles en-masse with relative ease. The refurbished rifles fired a 13x71mm black powder cartridge, and had the stopping power required to knock a tribal warrior to the ground with ease. It quickly became a symbol of the war against the tribes, with many post-bellum film appearences."
