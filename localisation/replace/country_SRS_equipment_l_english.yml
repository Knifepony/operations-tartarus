#### EQUIPMENT - INFANTRY ####
SRS_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Hinterladerbuchse Model 970/02"
SRS_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Hinterlader M970/02"
SRS_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "In 1002, Asper Sickleclaw encouraged an ultimately successful project to convert the stockpiles of Vorderlader Model 70 muzzle-loader rifles into breech-loading rifles en-masse with relative ease. The refurbished rifles fired a 13x71mm black powder cartridge, and had the stopping power required to knock a tribal warrior to the ground with ease. It quickly became a symbol of the war against the tribes, with many post-bellum film appearences."
SRS_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Gewehr M07"
SRS_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Gewehr M07"
SRS_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Gewehr M07 was the Skynavian contribution to the world of bolt-action rifles. Its manufacturing was delayed by the fact that the Imperial rifle cartridge used by the rifle had insufficient stopping power to stop a tribal warrior, requiring three rounds to take one down during its field trial. The tribal war's end meant that the Skynavian army could equip itself against more… civilized threats."
SRS_infantry_equipment_2:0 "MP10"
SRS_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "MP10"
SRS_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The MP10 came to be as most know it due to the rising relevance of sub-machine guns. The "Rotfahne" armaments collective had been commissioned to develop a cheap, easy to make stop-gap SMG to serve alongside the Gewehr M07. It fired a unique 7.5x28mm cartridge that was written off as "too weak" in the early stages of its service. It was so easy and cheap to manufacture (16 Equestrian Bits were the collective price of all materials required to produce one!)"
SRS_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Selbstladergewehr M13"
SRS_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "Selbstladergewehr M13"
SRS_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Skynavian SlG M13, chambered in a new shorter cartridge - 7.5x46mm "Skynavian", is the replacement for the aging bolt-action Gewehr M07. It had a 12-round box magazine, so that soldiers on patrol could still have 10 rounds without compromising the durability of the magazines. It served alongside the MP10/13, the lesser known but more aesthetically pleasing variant of the MP10, kitted out with wooden furniture and a grip to encourage soldiers to stop using the magazine well itself as a grip when firing."
SRS_infantry_equipment_4:0 "SlG M13/18"
SRS_infantry_equipment_4_short:0 "SlG M13/18"
SRS_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "A significant upgrade over the M13, the M13/18 variant received a full-auto function. It was introduced alongside the new 24-round magazines to accommodate the increase in the rate of fire of the M13/18 variant, as well as providing a replacement for the original 12-round magazines. There were planned 50-round drums for use by the suppressive element of a squad, but a belt-fed LMG of the same calibre was adopted instead."
SRS_infantry_equipment_5:0 "Sturmgewehr M25"
SRS_infantry_equipment_5_short:0 "Sturmgewehr M25"
SRS_infantry_equipment_5_desc:0 "The StG M25 assault rifle was designed to both replace the M13 family of service rifles. It fired a new 7.5x38mm cartridge, allowing for controllable fully automatic fire, compared to the 7.5x46mm of the M13 rifles. The same design persisted with minor changes here and there. Its biggest change was in 1052 - a 5.4x38mm conversion designated StG M52."

### TANKS ###
SRS_gw_tank_equipment:0 "Fur Schreck"
SRS_gw_tank_equipment_short:0 "FS"
SRS_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "FS, or Fur Schreck tanks were similar to the armoured tractors used by the Stalliongradian revolutionaries. The armour was enough to stop small arms fire, and that was pretty much it. HMG and autocannon rounds can pierce any point of the vehicle, not to mention purpose-built AT rifles. Its only intended purpose was scaring away tribesponies and - hypothetically, at least - Cloudburian conscripts, with its armament being a fake cannon and a swivel mounted LMG."
SRS_light_tank_equipment_1:0 "LePzKpfw T-26"
SRS_light_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "LePzKpfw T-26"
SRS_light_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Leichte-PanzerKampfwagen T-26 tanks are indeed made in New Skynavia, but they were conceived by designers across the pond in Stalliongrad. They are agile vehicles, and armed with a 45mm cannon fit for engaging tanks of its generation. Their armour seemed less than satisfactory, with 15mm all around the hull and turret. Nonetheless, they served up until the Great Revolutionary War, when they were outmatched by newer Imperial tanks."
SRS_light_tank_equipment_2:0 "LePzKpfw-08"
SRS_light_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Dinkau"
SRS_light_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The “Leichte Panzer ‘08”, nicknamed “Dinkau” by the troops, was the first all-Skynavian design. Its armament was the 45mm found on the Stalliongradian T-26. Its armour was not to be scoffed at, for it had 40mm of armour all around the hull and turret. The frontal part of the hull was also sloped 50 degrees inwards and the sides were also sloped 35 degrees which provided 80mm and 60mm of effective protection respectively. The “Dinkau” tanks were the workhorse of the Skynavian Armoured Corps up until the Marks I was introduced in bigger numbers during the G.R.W."
SRS_light_tank_equipment_3:0 "StPz-Leichter M12"
SRS_light_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Lanzenreiter"
SRS_light_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The Standardt-Panzer M12 was the first "standard tank". Its armour is significantly thinner than the “Dinkau” tanks, with its 25mm armour on the hull and turret with only the hull being sloped 50 degrees, but its firepower consisting of a 75mm gun of the Marks I with the ability to penetrate every Imperial light and medium tank it encountered combined with its outstanding mobility make it a foe to be reckoned with."
SRS_medium_tank_equipment_1:0 "MitPzKpfw-10"
SRS_medium_tank_equipment_1_short:0 "Marks I"
SRS_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The symbol of the revolutionary armoured force during the Great Revolutionary War. While the Mittler Panzerkampfwagen ‘10 is lightly armoured - even less so than its predecessor, the “Dinkau” light tank - the “Marks” makes up for the lack of armour with the abundance of bite! With the turret-mounted 75mm gun, it was able to match the quality of the Imperial tanks, while the quantity was quite low compared to the Imperial armoured vehicles."
SRS_medium_tank_equipment_2:0 "MitPzKpfw-12"
SRS_medium_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Marks II"
SRS_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "An upgrade over the previous “Marks” model, the “Marks II” was in the early stages a replacement of the smaller turret with a bigger one, housing a new, longer 75mm gun. A new power plant was needed to carry both the up-armored hull - a needed upgrade to compensate for advancements in infantry AT weaponry - and the new up-gunned turret. The new gun paired with advancements in anti-tank cannon munitions had most certainly spoiled the tank crews operating this vehicle."
SRS_medium_tank_equipment_3:0 "StPz-Mittler M13"
SRS_medium_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Wanderer"
SRS_medium_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "The second of the “Standardtpanzer” series, intended to be a replacement of the “Marks” series et al, looks like an up-sized M12 “Lanzenreiter”. Its armour is potent - certainly more than the “Marks” tanks - and the firepower is even more potent, an improved long 90mm gun paired with APDS shells able to penetrate the armour of late-war Imperial tanks, with the “dart” being fast enough to pierce through both the armour and the enchantment."
