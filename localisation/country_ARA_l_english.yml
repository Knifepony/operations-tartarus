ARA_legacy_desc:0 "Once, long before the Empire, long before even Equestria and her Princesses, Arantigos Featherin ruled a realm that stretched from Midoria in the South to Romau in the North.\n\nAnd yet here we are, the pathetic remnants of a once mighty Kingdom whose King was feared and respected by Ponies and Griffons alike, but not all is lost.

### Focus ###
ARA_the_new_airforce:0 "The Birth of the Airforce"
ARA_the_new_airforce_desc:0 "The world is changing around us. No longer do Griffons have to fly with their wings alone; powerful engines allow us to soar through the skies. We should invest in the military applications of this technology, lest we fall behind."
ARA_new_fighters:0 "Dominate the Skies"
ARA_new_fighters_desc:0 "Bombers are quite good and all, but they are quite useless without anything to protect them. As such, we should focus our efforts on creating the best guardians for Arantigan skies."
ARA_further_development:0 "Experimental Fighters"
ARA_further_development_desc:0 "The possibilities of jet engines are fascinating. We should try to adapt this technology to our military. It could ensure the dominance of the skies for years to come."
ARA_new_heavy_fighters:0 "Heavier Models"
ARA_new_heavy_fighters_desc:0 "Our fighter designs are proving to be a success, but we need fighters with the range of bombers. Sacrificing agility for endurance, armor, and weapons may be the solution."
ARA_airports:0 "Sparletan Airfields"    
ARA_airports_desc:0 "Our planes cannot fly if they have nowhere to be stored and launch from. There are plenty of suitable locations for airfields, on the bright side. We need only to approve the construction."
ARA_foregin_designs:0 "Import Foreign Fighters"
ARA_foregin_designs_desc:0 "Given the small industry we have at our disposal, it would be better to start our airforce by buying some planes, rather then relying on building our own. We can improve on them later, after all."
ARA_napalm:0 "Napalm"
ARA_napalm_desc:0 "In a war, there can be no half measures. Either we are the victors, or we suffer a most ignoble defeat. Thus, our bombers will begin carrying a more devastating weapon - napalm. After all, they can't keep the war up if all their factories are in flames."
ARA_finest_aces:0 "The Finest Aces"
ARA_finest_aces_desc:0 "A superior training program will ensure only the best fly in our planes; our pilots will be the cream of the crop! In every aspect of warfare, Arantiga shall be at the very top!"
ARA_new_bombers:0 "Salt the Fields"
ARA_new_bombers_desc:0 "Regular bombers are good, but what we need are heavy duty warplanes; bombers that can take a beating and still survive to drop their payload. That is where the future of aeronautics lay."
ARA_new_closer_air:0 "Guard Our Troops"
ARA_new_closer_air_desc:0 "Coordination between air and land has clear tactical and strategic benefits; creating aircraft designs specifically to aid the boots on the ground will make them grateful for the wings above."
ARA_new_heavy_bombers:0 "Strategic Destruction"
ARA_new_heavy_bombers_desc:0 "Bombing key enemy positions; supply depots, railways, you name it, will require specialized planes. Designing some should be a priority."

#ARA_issue_of_economic_dependance:0 "Dealing with the Economy"
#ARA_issue_of_economic_dependance_desc:0 "Arantiga's economy is in a pitiful state, and we must see to the matter of resolving this issue if we wish to become a regional power. The first task on the list is deciding our stance towards Wingbardy."
#ARA_our_own_way:0 "Our Own Path"
#ARA_our_own_way_desc:0 "Arantiga must forge its own path. If we do not make ourselves economically independent, we will be, beyond our obligations in the Pact, forced into wars with them. As such, it is time to begin cutting ourselves free from the claws of Wingbardy's industry."
#ARA_build_roads:0 "Arantigan Railroad"
#ARA_build_roads_desc:0 "If we are to become an industrial power, we will need the base infrastructure for it. Preparing ourselves for the great leap forward is a must if we are to be economically separate."
#ARA_industrial_buildup:0 "Industrial Buildup"
#ARA_industrial_buildup_desc:0 "More factories can only benefit us. Therefore, it is logical we should center our efforts on expanding our industry. We shall give subsidies to a select number of companies."
#ARA_mining_operations:0 "Ores in the Hills"
#ARA_mining_operations_desc:0 "With the recent location of new metal deposits in Arantiga's hills, we can open up additional mines to secure more resources for our economy. Arantiga must be reliant on its own resource base, and not from foreigners."
#ARA_import_machinery:0 "Import Machinery"
#ARA_import_machinery_desc:0 "We will need tractors, trucks and other industrial machines to help fuel our growing industry. Purchasing some is an excellent solution to help us meet our material needs."
#ARA_foreign_experts:0 "Invite Foreign Experts"
#ARA_foreign_experts_desc:0 "Not only will allowing foreign exports to examine our economy benefit it, they will also help with the pandemic illiteracy rampaging around our nation. Incentives, however, will be required to attract them to Arantiga. A small price for progress, nonetheless."
#ARA_industrial_revolution:0 "Industrial Modernisation"
#ARA_industrial_revolution_desc:0 "With all our buildup, we can move ourselves away from our backward technology and into the age of industry proper!"
#ARA_transition_finished:0 "The Economy Reborn!"
#ARA_transition_finished_desc:0 "With the recent improvements to our economy complete, we can finally declare ourselves our own economic power, if only a small one. Arantiga stands proudly on the results of her own efforts."
#ARA_go_with_wingbardians:0 "Go With the Wingbardians"
#ARA_go_with_wingbardians_desc:0 "Our economy is already closely tied to Wingbardy. It only makes sense that we should therefore build up our ties and use them to our advantage. While this will, of course, make us dependent on Wingbardy, there are clear benefits to it as well."
#ARA_vinyards:0 "Expand Alubviran Vineyards"
#ARA_vinyards_desc:0 "Wine is a common luxury, enjoyed throughout Griffon lands and beyond. As such, it is in constant demand. Expanding our already present vineyards in Alubvira should help our economy prosper."
#ARA_tourism:0 "Encourage Tourism"
#ARA_tourism_desc:0 "Tourism is a wonderful thing. Ponies, griffons and even zebras come to visit and marvel at the wonders of our achievements. Encouraging them so that they come to spend their money in our country, therefore, is an excellent way to bring more money into our economy."
#ARA_tax_incentives:0 "Invite Investors"
#ARA_tax_incentives_desc:0 "Investors will be needed to bring money and business into our growing economy. Inviting and offering incentives to them should allow our economy to blossom."
#ARA_cement_factories:0 "Arantigan Lumber Industry"
#ARA_cement_factories_desc:0 "Our nation, small as it is, is home to a wide variety of forests. From aging oaks to young maples, Arantiga has no lack of biodiversity. And yet we have scarcely utilised this natural resource. After deliberation with Wingbardian investors, we shall begin exploiting our forests, but for each tree felled, we shall plant two new ones. This prevents the erosion of the soil and preserves our natural beauty."
#ARA_industrial_assistance:0 "Request Industrial Assistance"
#ARA_industrial_assistance_desc:0 "Arrogance has to be a thing of the past; we must be humble if we seek to gain power to place ourselves on equal footing with Wingbardy. Requesting assistance to develop and transition our economy is therefore a must."
#ARA_cigars:0 "Pontels Cigar Factory"
#ARA_cigars_desc:0 "Cigars are an excellent investment; not only are they used constantly, but they are easy to produce and will keep the citizenry placated. Rumours of life expectancy tanking as a result of overuse are just exaggerations."
#ARA_equals:0 "A New Path"
#ARA_equals_desc:0 "Our economy is reborn! Thanks to the cooperation of our allies, Arantiga stands tall and proud. Our economic ties to them bind us all together."
#ARA_science_base:0 "Modernisation Efforts"

ARA_new_age_new_army_desc:0 "We are entering a new era of warfare. Gone are the days of the spear and shield. Here and now is the age of guns and tanks. In order to face the threats of the new millennium, both civilians and military personnel must be in perfect cooperation."
ARA_new_academy:0 "Meet with the Generals"
ARA_new_academy_desc:0 "Once, we were the greatest nation on Griffonia. The ancient military doctrines need to be adapted to modernity. Our officers need to be reinstructed with a mix of classic and modern works about warfare. After that, it is time to develop new doctrines, and adapt to the ever-changing ways of war. The question is: which of our generals will we listen to?"
ARA_mobile_warfare_doctrine:0 "From Zebrica with Speed"
ARA_mobile_warfare_doctrine_desc:0 "Craterus has arrived from Zebrica, and brings with him the wonders of tanks, jeeps, and trucks. While the trenches of old stand tall and strong, these mechanical beasts lumber forth, destroying all who dare stand in our way. It is clear that adopting such a doctrine will only benefit us in the long run."
ARA_develop_doctrine:0 "Lead from the Front!"
ARA_develop_doctrine_desc:0 "It is said Arantigos favoured to lead the mobile wing of his army from the front. He did not fear danger and neither should our officers. If we are to adapt the risky manoeuvres that come with our doctrine, we need to show the troops that our officers are not afraid to lead them into battle themselves!"
ARA_cult_of_speed:0 "A Cult of Speed"
ARA_cult_of_speed_desc:0 "Speed is the deciding factor in warfare. If you can decide where to fight and who you face when, you have already won half your battles. And if we can push forward faster than they can retreat, then our enemies have no chance against us."
ARA_actual_trucks:0 "Unit Motorisation"
ARA_actual_trucks_desc:0 "Armoured, motorised infantry is an ideal the Great Conqueror himself never had access to. If one unit can act both as a hammer and an anvil, exploiting gaps and keeping an enemy in place, we should make haste to reform our army into such a force."
ARA_tanks_for_the_army:0 "Knights of the New Age"
ARA_tanks_for_the_army_desc:0 "In the past, stalwart Knights adorned in great armour battled against beasts of legend and the enemies of their nations. Now, it is clear that these Knights, while inspirational, are quite outdated. We must adapt to the times, or be left behind."
ARA_better_tanks:0 "Rolling Out"
ARA_better_tanks_desc:0 "Our armoured behemoths are ready to go forth and destroy our enemies. The tank has been revealed as a great weapon of war, which can multiply the strength of an army in the hands of a great tactician. Our foes will find that Arantigan tanks will outmanoeuvre and outfight anything they can bring to the battlefield."
ARA_superior_warfare_doctrine:0 "Blow them to Tartarus"
ARA_superior_warfare_doctrine_desc:0 "Arantigos Featherin himself already appreciated the use of weapons with longer range then your opponents. Nicator's words ring true: They cannot pose a threat to us if they are dead before they get to us."
ARA_develop_superior_doctrine:0 "Safe and Sound"
ARA_develop_superior_doctrine_desc:0 "We will defeat the enemy safe and sound in our bunkers while our artillery rips them to shreds. None will stand in our way. There is no reason to throw away Arantigan lives without reason, since any Arantigan is worth ten times that of another soldier."
ARA_mass_artillery:0 "Massed Artillery Fire"
ARA_mass_artillery_desc:0 "Through the use of massed artillery fire, we shall not only annihilate the enemy's fighting spirit, but also wreck their defences. The following infantry charge will see little to no resistance. The Great Conqueror himself used this tactic to great effect, disorganising the enemy’s front line and then trampling over them with a charge."
ARA_better_artillery:0 "Modern Artillery Pieces"
ARA_better_artillery_desc:0 "The days of catapults and ballistae are but legends. Gone are the days of star-shaped forts and cannons. Technology marches forward unrelentingly and in this new age, we have howitzers and bunkers. We must make sure we keep up with all new developments."
ARA_fancier_guns:0 "Preparing the Vanguard"
ARA_fancier_guns_desc:0 "Having all these big guns are virtually useless if we do not have the means to protect them. Even with all these new weapons, the Arantigan soldier is still the mainstay of the army. We should ensure that he is equipped with the best weapons that money can buy."
ARA_continous_planning:0 "Dedicated Officer Core"
ARA_continous_planning_desc:0 "With our big guns now being the central philosophy of our army, we should ensure our officers are able to put them to use, as well as assigning officers to these artillery crews so they are more efficient."
ARA_new_school:0 "The Sparleto Military Academy"
ARA_new_school_desc:0 "The ancient Academy in our capital has become the domain of dust and paper rot! But with our officer corps in place, we can turn the old grounds into a bustling hub of military knowledge once again. The spirit of conquerors still dwells in our people and with proper study, that spirit will manifest into its fullest potential."
ARA_new_guns:0 "Guns For the Troops"
ARA_new_guns_desc:0 "Even with artillery and tanks aplenty, the core of warfare will always truly be the brave infantry who risk their lives out there. The least we can do is make sure they are all armed properly."
ARA_new_artillery:0 "Cannons of the New Age"
ARA_new_artillery_desc:0 " With these new massive guns, no enemy will be able to hide from our might. No pillbox, no trench, no fortification will be able to stand up to the salvos of our guns. We will force them to face us on even ground!"
ARA_new_equipment:0 "Sturdy Shovels"
ARA_new_equipment_desc:0 "An infantryman cannot defend himself if he has no hole to hide in. Improving our support equipment should be a priority. An Arantigan infantryman should be able to march for days while fully packed. Surely they can carry an extra shovel or first aid kit."
ARA_spec_ops_program:0 "Cassander's "Forze Speciali""
ARA_spec_ops_program_desc:0 "Unconventional warfare is the deadliest. Using new tactics, we can surprise our foes with special operations. We merely need to plan the way we will fight."
ARA_nation_under_arms:0 "An Armed Society"
ARA_nation_under_arms_desc:0 "Tensions are rising rapidly all around us. It is clear that we cannot afford to stand back and watch the world burn. We must arm ourselves. Once, the entire nation was mobilized for conquest and if necessary, we can militarise again."
ARA_prepare_the_people:0 "Is a Polite Society"
ARA_prepare_the_people_desc:0 "Our griffons will not need to stay home and protect their families. They can join the army, since they know that in a militarized society, all those who stay behind will be protected as well."
ARA_the_cadets:0 "The Giovani Cadetti"
ARA_the_cadets_desc:0 "The Cadetti are a branch of Arantigan military scientists, tasked with developing new weapons for the military. We should expand their ranks and make sure to also task them with civilian projects if necessary."
ARA_guerilla_warfare:0 "No Surrender"
ARA_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "Surrender is the cowards’ path. We will fight to the death. Every last Arantigan will brave the perils of war, or die trying. The forests of Arantiga will be utilised for our partisan movement, with hidden equipment caches."
ARA_mandatory_training:0 "Implement Mandatory Military Training"
ARA_mandatory_training_desc:0 "We cannot afford for everygriff to remain a civilian. Everyone must be ready to be conscripted if it is needed. Therefore, all griffons should be trained in the ways of war, so that new recruits can quickly be prepared for combat, should the need arise."
ARA_radio_stations:0 "Military Frequencies"
ARA_radio_stations_desc:0 "If you know what your enemy is up to, you have already won half of the battle. Although spies remain important, new technologies will allow us to see the world far more clearly. We should make use of this."
ARA_extensive_coscription_laws:0 "Expand Conscription"
ARA_extensive_coscription_laws_desc:0 "Our military is quite small, and as such, we need a greater proportion of bodies watching the borders. Updating our conscription laws should serve to fix this issue nicely."
ARA_military_railroads:0 "Is a Functioning Society"

### Events ###
arantiga.1.t:0 "The Issue of Arantigan Economic Dependence"
arantiga.1.d:0 "As a small nation in southern Griffonia, Arantiga has never had the best of economies. When the Griffonian Empire collapsed, and Arantiga truly became independent, the situation worsened.\n\nBut not all seemed lost. Arantiga united with the Wingbardians to our south, and joined the Karthinian Pact in hopes of defending against aggressors and rebuilding its economy.\n\nSadly, Wingbardy used their ever growing influence over us to profit from our weakened economy. This has become a massive issue in Arantigan politics, seeing as how Wingbardian entrepreneurs and companies seize a majority of the profits made.\n\nThe question has yet to answered. How will Arantiga continue on? Will we cut ties with the Wingbardians, and strive to become economically independent from them? Or will we try and simply lower their influence, in an attempt to minimise the cons and maximising the pros of their economic 'assistance'?"
arantiga.1.a:0 "Arantiga shall control its own destiny!"
arantiga.1.b:0 "Perhaps we could become equals instead?"

arantiga.2.t:0 "The Ides of March"
arantiga.2.d:0 "Today was the day Dorotheos had been waiting for.\n\nIt was just shortly after two in the afternoon, and it seemed as if half of Sparleto was up in arms. Together with his followers, Dorotheos plowed his way through the capital city, all the way to the government district. There, the first shots were exchanged between loyalist police forces and soldiers. As the battle in the streets began to flare up, Dorotheos and his personal guard managed to breach the defenses, and entered the House of Government.\n\nMargareth stood in front of the window in her office, observing the battle. She had already called for reinforcements when she heard the first reports of the possible coup, but for now, their defences would need to hold.\n\nSuddenly, the door to her office was busted open, and as Margareth turned around, she saw her own brother, revolver in his claw, approaching her. She walked backwards, hitting the window behind her. Dorotheos armed his revolver as Margareth closed her eyes, praying to the gods.\n\nJust as he is about to pull the trigger, voices sound from outside the office, getting closer and closer, to the point where they're just around the corner."
arantiga.2.a:0 "It's Dorotheos' griffons, the coup succeeds!"
arantiga.2.b:0 "It's Margareth's reinforcements, Dorotheos is arrested!"

arantiga.3.t:0 "Dorotheos' Trial"
arantiga.3.d:0 "It was a sad moment for Margareth today. To see her own brother, with whom she had grown up and played with since they were both little chicks, on trial for treason. She held back the tears, at least for the moment, but she, and most likely everyone else in the courtroom knew that he was guilty, and that there was no hope in Boreas that he'd come out alive.\n\nThe trial itself did not take long. There were mountains of evidence, including witnesses, the many dead bodies in the streets of Sparleto and, last but not least, Margareth herself, whom he had tried to kill in person before her soldiers overwhelmed and arrested him.\n\nThe judge was cold, but only did his duty as he announced that Dorotheos was guilty as charged. Treason of the highest order. The punishment was none other than death.\n\nAs the guards dragged a grim-looking Dorotheos out of the courtroom, and past Margareth, she couldn't help but finally break out into tears."
arantiga.3.a:0 "May Boreas save him."

arantiga.4.t:0 "A Shift in Policy"
arantiga.4.d:0 "The recently attempted coup has shown us that our current government policies must be corrected in order to appease the public more. We must strive for a democratically elected government, in order to prevent any incidents like these in the future.\n\nLaws were passed, allowing almost complete freedom of speech. Criticizing the government and the Baroness' rule was no longer punishable, and any restrictions on forming political organizations were removed as well. Soon enough democrats and national communists were spreading word of their ideologies and finding more support among the dissatisfied populace. Some remained loyal to Baroness and her conservative rule."
arantiga.4.a:0 "Times are changing."

arantiga.5.t:0 "The First Election"
arantiga.5.d:0 "The news of the election made the nation rejoice, and all sorts of movements and parties began to campaign across the country, advertising for their cause and fighting for public support.\n\nShortly before the election was held, there were about three possible candidates that could come out as the victor in the upcoming election. The reformist PR, the currently ruling conservative SDL, or the socialist PCNA.\n\nThe vote has finally been held, and the results are in."
arantiga.5.a:0 "The Partito Riformatore secures a victory!"
arantiga.5.b:0 "The Sostenitori retain leadership!"
arantiga.5.c:0 "The Partito Comunista Nazionale wins!"

arantiga.6.t:0 "Shaking Claws"
arantiga.6.d:0 "The Riformatore have been chosen by the people to represent them, but they are regarded as wide eyed optimists by the old guard. Sensing that this could inhibit their attempts to reform the country, Antioco Moro has seeked an audience with the former ruler of Arantiga, Margareth Featherin.\n\nSeveral hours has passed as the two sides have deliberated on how extensive Arantiga's reforms will be, primarily focused on the topics of military, education and industry. To the relief of most griffons, the talks have been a success, and the old nobility shall support the democratically chosen government of Arantiga. They have already pledged to finance the construction of a new cement factory."
arantiga.6.a:0 "Brilliant!"

arantiga.7.t:0 "The Arantigan Identity"
arantiga.7.d:0 "Arantiga is not the home of radicals, of those who would seek trouble or the destruction of society or peace. Arantiga is home to those who seek to sow peace, only to harvest prosperity. Let us go forth, claw in claw, and heed the Baroness' call, for she will guide us ever steadily into the future."
arantiga.7.a:0 "Lunga vita alla Baronia!"

arantiga.8.t:0 "The Sparletan Rebirth"
arantiga.8.d:0 "The national revival of Dorotheos goes far, further than many had first expected. Today, the ancient Sparletan language was officially revived and introduced as a second official language. While some citizens are annoyed at having to learn a long dead language, many see this as a great cultural revival, and welcome this decision. Additionally, this allows us to remove foreign influences from our language that we deem to be unpatriotic."
arantiga.8.a:0 "Zíto o Sparléos!"

arantiga.9.t:0 "Arantigos Reborn!"
arantiga.9.d:0 "The time has come to reclaim the glory of our homeland! Arantiga, once proud and prosperous, has only been held back by its so called "allies" in the recent past, and it was once trampled by the vile imperials. No longer, I say! Let us revive our nation's glory, and march on! March on toward the bright light of victory!"
arantiga.9.a:0 "The world shall be mine!"

arantiga.10.t:0 "Coup In Arantiga"
arantiga.10.d:0 "News has reached us about the coup that has recently struck the small barony of Arantiga. In what is dubbed "the ides of March" by the local population, a prominent general by the name of Dorotheos Featherin has seized control of the state, and is already in the process of expelling foreign influences, as he promises a return to "Arantiga's ancient roots". One of his first decisions was leaving our formal alliance pact.\n\nAlthough Arantigan history is certainly impressive, yet filled with bloodshed, the joint military staffs of the Pact believe there is no real threat coming from such a minor nation. After all, what are the chances of a new Arantigos rising up to conquer the continent?"
arantiga.10.a:0 "We'll keep an eye on Arantiga."

### NEW EVENTS ###
arantiga.001.t:0 "The Generals"
arantiga.001.d:0 "A cafe situated in the city capital of Arantiga was filled with off duty soldiers, amongst them Lieutenants, generals, and even the marshal. Dorotheos  Feathering sat exclusively with his generals, discussing a matter most important. Dorotheos  had ambitions, ambitions of restoring Arantiga, and today was the day he'd set in motion his plans of realizing those ambitions.\n"So generals, are we in agreement?" The generals looked at eachother, some unsure, some stern. "A coup, sir? Are you sure?" asked one, putting down their cup of coffee. "Of course, dear Soter. We have the support of the military, who would oppose us? Her guard? It would be suicide to oppose the entire military, Cassander. "He shook his head, speaking in agreement. "Suicide, those who matter are in support."\nDorotheos  continued, looking to his third general, "Lysimachus, any objections?" The General shrugged, saying. "One, what of those . . .  disloyal Generals? You say those who matter, but Nicator isn't on board, and most love the Baroness . . . " Dorotheos gave a light chuckle, grinning warmly. "Oh Lysimachus, Trust me! Trust your marshal . . . ""
arantiga.001.a:0 ""I have everything under control.""
arantiga.002.t:0 "The Planning"
arantiga.002.d:0 "Deep within the Arantigan countryside sat a simple homestead, nary a dirt path connecting it to any semblance of society. Around it, soldiers at guard waiting for any who would approach. Finding themselves at attention as a one of the Generals, Lysimachus approached via flight worried and looking flustered, he lands and rushes in, the door slamming shut.\nLysimachus quickened himself to the other Generals, who all turned to him, "Yes, I'm late . . . " He sat, and Dorotheos looked up from the map, not at all impressed but serious in expression. "Well, Lysimachus, let me get you up to speed . . . " In the middle of the table sat a map, containing the most up to date details of the Capital city; Sparleto.\n"The plan is simple . . .  with my leverage as the Marshal of the Army, Nicator and Arok will be stationed at the border, under the bogus claim that Revolutionaries from will try to jump it." Next spoke Soter, "I plan to keep my troops out of sight, if all goes south we'll move in for back up." Dorotheos looks to Cassander, who responds, pointing at key locations on the map. "Logistics, I will relieve the police chief of his . . .  burden and supplant my troops as the police force, if all goes well, the city should be under our control. Lysimachus?"\nThe Griffon cleared his throat, "Indeed, I'll have my troops stationed at all checkpoints around the City; No Griffon goes in and out until Dorotheos  is . . .  inaugurated." And with that, Dorotheos  nods his head, grinning. "Any Objections?" The generals sat silently, no objections were made."
arantiga.002.a:0 ""Then everything is under control . . . ""
arantiga.003.t:0 "The Ides of March"
arantiga.003.d:0 "Marshal Dorotheos Feathering was as nervous as could be, all this planning, months of it! Getting ready for what he was to commit on this day: He was ready! But despite all that, still, his chest was tight with anxiety. This was the first time he'd lead forces, he'd never fought in a formal war, just drills and bandits, this would be the first time . . . \nBut today would not be that day.\nToday he would handle this with tact. He would show all of Arantiga that if he was going to do this, it would be not with a drop of blood spilled. He needed to show his people that they came first, and that striking any of them down, even for a Coup d'état! Was out of the question. It would send a Message, of who Dorotheos is, and how much his people meant to him.\nHe had been escorted by an entourage of his personal Guards to the palace, coming face to face with the palace's guard and his Sister, Margareth Featherin the baroness. He needed to handle this. He and his griffons made their way as close as they could before the palace guards demanded they halt.\nDorotheos knew what he had to do. His guards parted and out he came, Megaphone in claw. Unarmed (Mostly, he always kept a revolver as his side, as do all Generals) as to convey that he was no threat, he looked to The Guard . . .  and pleaded his case.\n"Look . . . " He began, the megaphone barely up to his beak, he was very well within shooting distance of the Guard. "I don't want violence, all of this . . .  It was to reduce the probability of violence! I refuse to spill Arantaigan blood, Don't you all agree?". He looked up and around to the armed guards. "Isn't that what you fight for? Or is it perhaps a who? The Baroness?" He scoffs, rolling his eyes.\n"My dear sister, clawless, bending the knee to Wingbardy, what kind of fight is that? Is it even a fight? Is this what you're going to die over? Perpetuating this worthless excuse for a regime? I am offering- no, GIVING you all the chance to lay down your arms, and simply . . .  Go home. Go home to your families, be it your mothers or fathers . . . " He lowers his voice. "Or your sons and daughters, go home and the next time you take up arms, it won't be for Wingbardy or this excuse for a Baroness!"\nDorotheos takes to the sky, clenched claw in the air. "It'll be for you, and your sons, and your daughters, It will be . . .  FOR ARANTIGA!""
arantiga.003.a:0 ""Speak softly, and carry a big megaphone.""
arantiga.004.t:0 "Finality"
arantiga.004.d:0 "Dorotheos had stood before his sister's chambers, having stared at the door for what seemed like hours, wondering what would happen, what he should do, how he should do it, how she’ll respond. Will she fight? Is the silence due to her having taken her own life? Dorotheos reached for the revolver at this side, a claw on the door, turned the doorknob.\nNothing. He entered and closed the door behind him. As if this was any old visit, raising his gaze to his ‘Dear Sister’, With a quill in her hand as she wrote away on a piece of parchment. She paused for a moment before continuing.\n"Sister . . . " Dorotheos began, before his sister interjected, a shaky sound to her voice. On the brink of tears. "At ;east let me finish, this will be my last will and testament . . . " Dorotheos bowed his head, shaking it. Thinking to himself how unpleasant this must be. The Baroness set down her quill, and turned to stand, simply stating; "Be done with it."\nDorotheos looked to his revolver, he loaded one round, he thought to himself how symbolic it would be. This coup had one singular shot fired, with one singular casualty. And of course he’d have second doubts, fratricide is never pleasant, required or not. He’d know that if he had failed this coup, that his own penalty for this form of high treason would be death, even if his sister did not want it.\n\nLeaders need to make hard choices, this shall be his first. He raised the firearm and pulled back the hammer. His sister’s last words as the hammer came down on the chambered round; "Tell yourself, as you sit on a throne that was once mine-""
arantiga.004.a:0 ""Will this be worth it?""
arantiga.005.t:0 "Prodigal Sons"
arantiga.005.d:0 "Arantiga is famed for its martial traditions - even after old Kingdom of Sparleos collapsed due to infighting between great Arantigos generals and heirs, remnants of its military remained. In fact, when Grover I conquered Griffonia, he used arantigan legions as base for his new imperial army. Even now, there is number of arantigan mercenary groups, often having tens or even hundreds of years of tradition roaming through continent and beyond - and many of them, despite never seeing their homeland is still cultivating old traditions. Now, when Dorotheos is in charge, one of these groups, Sons of Arantigos, which gained famed in Zebrica when they fought against Storm King army, returned to our nation and pledged fealty to new baron. Its captain, Craterus suggested that he could contact other groups and try to convince them to join Dorotheos’ cause."
arantiga.005.a:0 "Welcome home brothers and sisters! "
arantiga.006.t:0 "Destiny Revealed"
arantiga.006.d:0 "Dorotheos could not focus. In last month he was suffering nightmares on almost daily basis. He barely slept and ruling or planning military campaigns further exhausted him. Now he tried to focus on studying map of imperial-arantigan borderlands . . .  Suddenly he felt . . .  dizzy. Moments later everything went black and Dorotheos fell from his chair.\n . . . Beautiful. He could not find a better word. Nothin in world of mortals could be compared to heavenly mountains. So . . .  Was it the end? That was how it would end? He went forward, until finally reached a garden, in a middle of which stood golden fountain . . .  Everything seemed exactly as priests were saying – however there were no gods and for sure, not his ancestors . . .  Dorotheos frowned when he realized, that in afterlife he might actually meet his sister . . .  And is probably would not be a pleasant meeting? But maybe was it simply a hell? He once heard a half-mad priest saying that hell is not a realm of tortures, but simply eternal solitude – worst punishment that gods could have created.

Although doctors suggested rest, Dorotheos decided not to delay planned coronation – to cement his recent conquests Arantiga would be elevated to status of kingdom!\nCeremony took place in recently rebuild Griffinstone – however all traces of former Guto dynasty were removed from palace and replaced with symbols of house Featherin. Crowds of arantigan soldiers, and citizens gathered to participate in ceremony that meant return of old glory. When Dorotheos was crowned by prelate Heraclius, he decided to deliver a speech to gathered griffons.\n"Brave soldiers of Arantiga and hard working citizens.

A few well-surviving relics of the past that he had ordered to not be removed when refurbishing the old palace, laid about the room waiting to be given the attention they deserved. Much like the depraved city itself until he finally stepped in. He turned to muse at a mosaic that depicted Grover receiving a blessing from Boreas himself. It lacked more than few stones but it still was quite magnificent.\nFor a brief moment he wondered about Grover's thoughts, when he sat here in this palace, as he was planning his seemingly impossible conquests. Would he have been able to do so without the power of the Idol? Cracking sounds of an opening door returned him to reality. A group of his soldiers were half-leading, and half-dragging a brown-white, very loudly cursing griffoness. As they approached near, she was tossed before the throne.\n\n"We told you to do this in... a civilized manner." Arantigos told the commander of the soldiers. \n\n"Lord Arantigos, she told us she had better business to do than answer some questions. She called you the ‘warlord with an ego the size of the Griffonstone tree’, and resisted arrest."\n"I was wrong. His ego is the size of the goddamned Lake Rumare!" snapped the griffoness. She had a good view to witness a rather kitschy painting depicting Arantigos I handing a sword to Dorotheos. "This place was trashy beyond imagination, but now it looks like an Aquileian circus!" \n"We must admit, she has guts," said Arantigos. "But you are not here to advise me on interior decoration. The Idol of Boreas. We were being told you, and some Equestrian ponies, were the last ones to try and reclaim it. Where is it?"\n"The Idol? It fell deeper into the Abysmal Abyss which happens to be a death trap in case you forgot. Besides, it was just a useless piece of gold... at least so I heard. Going down there is suicide, and the idol is unreclaimable. No one can get down there safely with those wind gusts, as fast as a train, going through. We were only lucky to have made it out at all."\n"You will show us that place…" Arantigos smiled faintly, "and then we will see if it really is ‘unreclaimable’ as you say."\n"Only a madgriff would try to go down there! You cannot be THAT crazy are you?!"\n"They told us so when we marched on Griffonstone..."

He gets results. And thesoldiers love him, they will follow him until he is victorious. Not to say that Lysimachus will rather die than betray him, Cassander I guess will follow him too.”\n“What about you?” Asked Nicator.\n“Me?” Soter stayed silent for awhile. “We are surrounded by enemies.

### Leader Descriptions ###
generic_neutral_leader_desc:0 "Baroness Margareth Featherin has been ruling Arantiga for the past decade with a just and fair claw, but even she cannot deny that under her reign, there has been a decisive lack of progress as Wingbardian capitalists seized most of the Arantigan industry. However, she believes that the pen is mightier than the sword, and that Arantiga's current woes can be resolved with a few careful words, something her more notable brother and general in the army, Dorotheos, disagrees with."
literally_alexander_desc:0 "The younger brother of the former Baroness, Dorotheos Featherin has been yearning to learn about the Arantigan military as long as he could remember. He spent many hours in the national library perusing the tales of old Arantigos, how he had defeated armies more numerous than his, only to be felled by the plague after his latest conquest. Since then, Dorotheos has made it his life goal to join the Arantigan officer corps, with his brilliant mind astounding even the most senior leadership. His quick rise to success can be attributed solely to his capabilities, and once he was in position to reform the armed forces, he did so with great fervour, restoring some of their old glory. But this was not enough for Dorotheos, as he wished above all to restore the ancient Kingdom. The die was cast, and the coup was a success - he shall restore Arantiga's glory."
generic_harmony_birb_desc:0 "One of the many Wingbardian investors who made their fortune in Arantiga, Antioco Moro has made Arantiga his home. Smitten by the local culture and history, he has invested much of his profits into rebuilding Arantiga, and unlike his fellow capitalists, his workers had a fair paycheck and numerous benefits. The dreadful coup has almost destroyed his lifework, and he was one of the first to gather his political party for the elections, campaigning on the promises of a better, peaceful Arantiga. The populace have not forgotten his contribution to the society, and he now leads Arantiga to a brighter tomorrow."
another_nazbol_guy_desc:0 "Ciriaco Mediate leads the new Arantiga. He was content as a common soldier in the Arantigan army, proud of his state, but much changed after he read a particularly thought provoking manifesto. The Rozenkamp brothers' unique blend of socialism and nationalism great inspired him, and he began spreading his views within his battalion. Although some suspect he was covertly supporting Dorotheos in his failed coup, he dismissed all those claims, saying that the state must achieve balance between the patriots and the proletariat. Ciriaco's extreme ideology has found fertile ground in every aspect of Arantiga's society, even as some questioned its viability."
alexander_but_woke_desc:0 "Dorotheos Featherin has heard Boreas' instructions and he has taken them well. Having proclaimed himself the reborn Arantigos, he is set to fulfill his destiny and reestablish the ancient Kingdom. This he swears."

Arantigans have no forgotten their legacy, and we were, and still are, famed for our martial traditions. There are plenty of mercenary companies composed of Arantigans, their descendants or groups of griffons who have not forgotten their heritage and who are willing to return to their ancestral homeland to reclaim its former glory..."

ARA_last_legion_desc:0 "The so called 'Karthin Legion' claims to be the descended from the armies of the fallen Kingdom of Karthin, conquered by Wingbardians ages ago.

tungsten_desc:0 "Literally just a piece of tungsten. It was promoted in 1005 by Dorotheos as a way to poke fun at Nicator and as such, it has its own desk, uniform, salary, and right to be present in the general staff meetings."
soter_desc:0 "Soter Litori, the owl of Arantiga, was born in 980 in the forests south of Ponteles. One of the brightest mind of the Arantigan general staff, his upbringing in the boondocks gave him the skills to traverse the thick forests of Arantiga with ease, and teach others how to do it. This, along with his charisma and great loyalty to the state of Arantiga made him (at the time of his promotion at 26 years old) the youngest General in the Arantigan Army."
cassander_desc:0 ""Commando Cassander" as he's often called, is the Griffon in charge of the Divisione di Forze Speciali, also called "that place where money goes in and invisible griffons come out" by Dorotheos"

Able to inspire soldiers to almost the same level of zealotry as him, he is in charge of rectruiting the new generation of arantigans into the army"
nicator_desc:0 "Nicator Whitebeak, second both in command structure and ego size of the arantigan army, after Dorotheos himself of course. Promoted by the Duchess Margareth, Nicator is famous for his strategy of shelling the enemy to tartarus, and being damn good at doing it too."
