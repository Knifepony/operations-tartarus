#### LEADERS ####
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME:0 "Skynavian General Congress"
SKYNAVIAN_GENERAL_CONGRESS_NAME_DESC:0 "The governing body of the Socialist Republic of Skynavia since its formation, the Skynavian General Congress is made up of 80 delegates representing their respective constituencies. These delegates are nominated from amidst their communities and democratically elected to serve short terms, with each term usually being one-third of a year, and can be re-elected for a maximum of three terms. Because these delegates are responsible for representing the opinions of their electorates they are subject to immediate recall and replacement if the General Congress undertakes decisions unfavourable to their constituency.\n\nThis system of governance ensures that power remains decentralised at the behest of the people by preventing the formation of a politican caste.\n\nAlthough the General Congress is sometimes inefficient due to its delegates all being amateurs at statecraft, the Congress can proudly lay claim to being one of the most democratic institution in all of Griffonia, and perhaps in the entire world as well."
JOHN_CARLINI_NAME_DESC:0 "John Carlini grew up in a rich merchant district in Skyfall, experiencing a pampered childhood provided by his businessgriff father.\n\nGoing to the Cyrusval University in Yale for his higher studies, he became radicalised by the socialist thought prevalent in the University's Faculty of Social Sciences. Thoroughly disillusioned with his bourgeois upbringing, as soon as he graduated he signed up to one of the many mercenary companies fighting in the conflicts flaring up all around the world.\n\nHaving participated in the fierce fighting in the fields of Prywhen on the Communist side, Carlini arrived at the Socialist Republic of Skynavia bringing with him those of his mercenary company he was able to win over to the ideals of socialism. Now, he aspires to fight for a higher cause - that of the liberation of the proletariat of Griffonia."
SICKLECLAW_NAME_DESC:0 "Asper Sickleclaw was a junior lieutenant in the Griffonian army when the First Revolution smashed the Empire to pieces. Marching alongside his fellow revolutionaries, Sickleclaw participated in most of the battles against the monarchist counter-revolution, eventually ending up in Cloudbury along with the remnants of the Republican government.\n\nHaving witnessed the despotism and authoritarianism of the Republican generals, Sickleclaw, anticipating the Republic's spiral into warlordism, adopted socialist views and marched onwards north, leading disillusioned socialists and other leftists away from the crumbling Republic into the virgin lands of Skynavia, where they hoped to start anew, free from the baggage of capitalist militarism.\n\nNow a staunch Internationalist, Sickleclaw is the foremost military leader of the Skynavian Socialist Republic, and is looked up to by most as a revered war hero, though some have raised concerns over what they perceive to be autocratic tendencies in his leadership."
GRANGER_NAME_DESC:0 "An aspiring officer cadet of the Imperial Guard in his youth, Granger turned his back on all the riches of the Griffonian Empire, choosing instead to put his expertise at the service the socialist revolution.\n\nAs with most military leaders in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, Granger is an avowed Internationalist, as well as being a close friend and ideological ally of Field Marshal Sickleclaw."
PROUDPONE_NAME_DESC:0 "Pierre Ponehon was born in Prance, Equestria, but left his overbearing family at an early age to travel the world. In Griffonia, he got tangled up with the revolutionaries and while initially a mercenary, he adopted the ideals of socialism swiftly and eagerly, even publishing some writings about an own more radical form of anarchist socialism.\n\nHe'll ask Maar for help before he asks Boreas and would serve Nightmare Moon before Celestia: whoever fights the powers that be in the world he will gladly support. After the failed revolution and the flight north he departed to aid other socialist movements around the world. These have included Stalliongrad, Longsword and the Brodfeld Revolutionaries and no matter where he has gone, he has only been more convinced of the need to send the old order crashing down."
GOLDGRIFF_NAME_DESC:0 "Born in Nova Griffonia in 946 as the daughter of a dockworker, Emma Goldgriff was introduced to the works of Caramel Marks and Steel Stallion at an early age and spent some time in Stalliongrad during her younger years. During the revolution of 978 she was already a published author and participated eagerly in the struggle, as well as the retreat.\n\nInstead of remaining in Skynavia, however, she departed after the founding of the socialist republic as she felt she could not sit idly in the north and just write. Since then, she had travelled the world - often undercover - as an author and agitator. She especially has taken an interest in the social aspects of the revolution and is as comfortable leading partisans as she is arguing for revised social norms. "
BEAKUNIN_NAME_DESC:0 "Beakunin is one of the oldest and most influential of the griffonian revolutionaries, called a "father of the revolution" by many of his supporters. Born in the Heartlands of the Griffonian empire, Beakunin was in Equestria on a business trip during the early 950s when he met the legendary Caramel Marks. The sharp-witted young griffon caught Caramel Marks' attention and Beakunin was a quick and attentive learner. He was, however, not a very orthodox student and clashed ceaselessly with the old pony on matters of ideology and method. During the griffonian revolution he was one of the most important leaders and, along with Sickleclaw, was the leader during the retreat north.\n\nHe departed when it was clear the Skynavian Socialist Republic would focus on rebuilding and recovering rather than pursue the expansion of the Socialist Revolution worldwide, and has since then helped train and organize revolutionaries wherever needed. He may be in his eighties, but he will not stop as long as he can move."
HORSON_WELLES_NAME_DESC:0 "Horson Welles began his illustrious career as a socialist revolutionary in his native Equestria, where in his early adulthood he produced numerous groundbreaking films equally revered for their avant-garde creativity and progressive values.\n\nLater he travelled across the ocean to the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, where he could experience and document the griffons' revolutionary struggle firsthoof.\n\nIn his youth, Horson took part in many shooting competitions, and got very good at marksponyship."

#### IDEAS ####
SRS_young_chick:0 "Emilia Stalwart"
SRS_young_chick_desc:0 "Born to a pair of determined socialist revolutionaries from the Heartlands, Emilia Stalwart was only a child when the Socialist Republic of Skynavia was established. Having experienced an education couched in socialist ideology, Emilia nevertheless was not satisfied with her life in Skynavia, instead choosing to go visit the capitalist countries of the south when she graduated.\n\nHaving experienced firstclaw the depredations of capitalism, authoritarianism, and monarchism during her travels, she has now returned to her home an ardent internationalist, carrying within her an immutable resolve to change the world for the better."

SRS_rejoin_kemerskai_gang_desc:0 "Despite disagreements in the past, Sickleclaw and Kemerskai are, despite unwilling to trust each other at the moment, willing to co-operate against the empire.

SRS_bend_the_knee:0 "Bend the Knee"

SRS_republican_dream:0 "The Republican Dream"
SRS_republican_dream_desc:0 "The so-called "Republican Dream" is not a mere piece of propaganda to decieve the people. After all, everything a common griffon desires is a peaceful life, and the "Republican Dream" is just that."

SRS_radical_backlash_desc:0 "The radicals are voicing their dissatisfaction. The internationalists will be easy to handle, but the communalists... let's just say that they will need to go. We're sure our internationalist and moderate comrades won't mind, for they are a rather... colourful bunch."
SRS_congress_two_boogaloo:0 "Sickleclaw's Republican Congress"
SRS_congress_two_boogaloo_desc:0 "We need to have the interests of the people in our premier interest. Sickleclaw is going to make the General Congress building something more than a glorified office building by founding a congress, this time with creatures who know what they're doing."
SRS_sensible_labour_laws:0 "Sensible Labour Laws"
SRS_sensible_labour_laws_desc:0 "The first act that will most definitely pass through the new congress is to guarantee the fundamental rights of every creature within our borders that toils for eight hours a day. This will give the people faith in the new congress."

SRS_reforge_enthusiasm:0 "Reforge Enthusiasm"
SRS_reforge_enthusiasm_desc:0 "Our internationalist comrades' enthusiasm had drastically weakened after the re-alignment with Kemerskai. Thankfully, Sickleclaw existence is the sole reason the streets of New Skyanvia are not soaked in blood... yet. Action must be taken immediately."
SRS_promise_pan_griffonia:0 "Promise Pan-Griffonia"
SRS_promise_pan_griffonia_desc:0 "It seems so distant, yet, with the Empire too busy keeping control of Herzland, it seems close. All we need is to engage in decisive battle. Take Griffenheim, and the Pan-Griffonian ideal will come true."

SRS_yeet_communalists_desc:0 "Communalist thought was our foremost obstacle preventing us from ending the "War in the North" before it took tens of thousands of lives on both sides. With the most radical communalists out in the streets, we have a "casus belli" to put an end to their opposition."
SRS_hail_forest_administration:0 "The Hail Forest Administration"
SRS_hail_forest_administration_desc:0 "Many rather immature internationalists have a slogan - "Comrade Asper, Do It Again!".

"Do it Again!"."
SRS_unite_the_north:0 "Unite the North"
SRS_unite_the_north_desc:0 "We shall prove our worth to the Republican cause and unite the north, while Cloudbury "un-fucks" itself. Sickleclaw will win favour among the republican movements of Griffonia for the deed, too."
SRS_approach_the_tribes:0 "Approach the Tribes"
SRS_approach_the_tribes_desc:0 "The Congress has decided to peacefully approach the tribes. It is known that they are traditionally a peace-loving federation of tribes that fight furiously once their peace had been disturbed, which explains the furiousity we faced during our march further north back in 986. A harmonic union will be most beneficial to both peoples, and is possible."
SRS_meet_with_waifu:0 "Meet with Fiana"
SRS_meet_with_waifu_desc:0 "After our pony diplomats somehow managed to break the language barrier and negotiated for a cease-fire, it is time for Sickleclaw to personally shake claw and hoof with the leader, Princess Fiana II. It will be a very... interesting encounter to say the least."

SRS_republican_yeetbrantbeak:0 "Secure the Mountains"
SRS_republican_yeetbrantbeak_desc:0 "We must secure our eastern flank. Unfortunately for us, it will be a hard uphill fight considering this is a heavily mountainous region. After all, dealing with the local native militia would go much smoother than dealing with an Imperial army group in those mountains, and the gains in resouces such as steel beckon."
SRS_speak_herzlander:0 "The Speak Herzlander Program"
SRS_speak_herzlander_desc:0 "The "Speak Herzlander" program is to make Herzlander an universal language understood at an rudimentary level by every citizen, without alienating the native tongues of non-herzlander citizens.

SRS_warplans:0 "Warplans"
SRS_warplans_desc:0 "Our army isn't a collection of ill-standardized militias anymore. It is akin to Sickleclaw's militia brigades before the power-grab - standardized, uniformed and trained.

SRS_monarchists_be_gone:0 "Solidarity with the Vedinian People"
SRS_monarchists_be_gone_desc:0 "The un-educated masses of Vedina don't care who is the tax collector, 'tis the harsh truth. Therefore, we are only facing serious resistance in urban areas such as Turhamn. We need to show the Vedinian people that we are their faithful friends, and allies in the grand alliance against Imperial tyranny."
SRS_bandits_be_gone:0 "Total Pacification of Brantbeak"
SRS_bandits_be_gone_desc:0 "Improving the lives of the citizenry of this region, along with some state-mandated propaganda, is thought that this will induce everygriff who lived under severe poverty and threat of getting robbed be hardline patriots of our country.

SRS_unite_with_fatmerskai_playeronly_desc:0 "Sickleclaw has proven his worth, and gained back the favour of the Republican cause. The Skynavian authority is ready to merge with the Cloudbury authority, effectively putting the idea of "one nation, two systems" to the test."
SRS_strike_the_revisionists:0 "Srike the Revisionists"
SRS_strike_the_revisionists_desc:0 "The worst case scenario had occured in Cloudbury. The warlords have overthrown Kemerksai's government. This is of course good for Sickleclaw - he would be the legitimate leader of the Repuiblican cause, implying he shows these tyrants and criminals what-for!"

SRS_unfinished_urban_projects:0 "Unfinished Urban Projects"
SRS_unfinished_urban_projects_desc:0 "It's the same story every time: internationalists want to build a centralized factory, it gets finished half-way, then the communalists go ahead and stall the project, letting the unfinished factory take up the little space we have. Now that the internationalists don't have a leash, it's nigh time to finish construction of these buildings for the good of the Skynavian people."

SRS_small_scale_dinkau_desc:0 "Contacting the previously-uncontacted settlers of Dinkau is going to allow us to reap the benefits of their local industry.

SRS_consolidated_gunmakers_union_desc:0 "There are dozens of independent minor gunmakers in both urban and rural communities.

SRS_mass_unionization:0 "Mass Unionization"

SRS_inland_industry:0 "Inland Industrial Development"
SRS_inland_industry_desc:0 "Until now, only New Skynavia proper, Dinkau, and Bluffhead bore the brunt of industrial development. To keep the population of Braunles and Ostfloy away from migrating en-masse to the big cities, we shall develop those two provinces, so that they are stars of the north, shining alongside New Skynavia."
SRS_military_industry_focus:0 "Arsenal of Socialism"
SRS_military_industry_focus_desc:0 "Claiming the title of "The Arsenal of Socialism" with our current military capacity is quite frankly laughable. We shall consctruct new munitions plants in the Braunles-Ostfloy region."

SRS_breathe_skynavia:0 "Breathe, Skyanvia!"
SRS_breathe_skynavia_desc:0 "Years ago, New Skynavia was a grim place to live in. Grey high-rise buildings, which made up the bulk of the living space of the city were not a beautiful sight.

SRS_the_northern_star:0 "The Northern Star"
SRS_the_northern_star_desc:0 "Our people live in heaven-on-griffonia already, but we can do better. By establishing a market-socialist economy, and positive relations with the harmonic, albeit capitalist nations of the world, it will allow socialists from those countries to easily immigrate to Skynavia. And, with the end of the "art project", our city is worth of a better name... Nova Skynavia sounds good?"
SRS_libtard_economics:0 "A Market Economy"
SRS_libtard_economics_desc:0 "As we're rejoining the Republican cause, we should strive to improve our economy via the free market. We can't go around making Skynavia a capitalist paradise overnight, though, so a market socialist economy will do just fine."

Retreating from a conquerable Imperial force, while knowing well the Imperial scum will raze yours and your comrades' livelihoods to the ground both is and will be portrayed as the most vile act a creature can commit.

Now that they have Sickleclaw, with his Northern Unification Expedition's success, our voices can not be ignored anymore, for the isolationists are outnumbered now!"
SRS_border_buildup:0 "Border Buildup"
SRS_border_buildup_desc:0 "There is a high chance of an immediate Imperial offensive upon our proclamation. We shall shore up our immediate border defenses in order to withstand their initial blow. Afterwards, their exausted cohorts will drown in their own blood after we launch an offensive of our own."

SRS_mobilize_economy:0 "Mobilize the Economy"
SRS_mobilize_economy_desc:0 "During war, we can't afford producing Boreas-forsaken chocolates, wether or not our soldiers are equipped. Modern war is a cruel mistress, and we must adapt in every way."

SRS_prepare_the_people_desc:0 "The emotional impact war has on the homefront is one of the deciding factors of modern warfare. Therefore, we must prepare the people and start preparing them for the storm to come. They will face the real deal with a stiff upper beak and walk to air raid shelters with a proud stride after a while."
SRS_republican_coalition:0 "The Grand Republican Coalition"

SRS_invite_aquileia:0 "Invite Aquileia"
SRS_invite_aquileia_desc:0 "Name a more glorious republican nation than Aquileia! Perhaps that might be us, but two titans of republicanism will be a challenge for the Empire indeed."
SRS_invite_skyfall:0 "Invite Skyfall"
SRS_invite_skyfall_desc:0 "Madamme Genevieve's blend of socialism and free market thought has seduced Sickleclaw and his followers, on top of other prominent harmonists in the Republic. Not including Skyfall ruled by her in the coalition would be a waste, for quite obvious reasons, one of them being the Imperial navy of old."
SRS_victory:0 "Victory!"
SRS_victory_desc:0 "The triband is flying over Griffenheim once again, and we should all be grateful for Sickleclaw and his actions: unifying the north almost single-clawedly and rejoined the cause. This decisive thinking resulted in our current standing in the world, and Sickleclaw has an obvious advantage in the upcoming elections following the liberation of Griffenheim."
SRS_herzland_conquered:0 "The Liberation of Herzland"
SRS_herzland_conquered_desc:0 "It is time to engage in the reconsctruction of Griffonian society as a whole. The Empire has tried to rise from the ashes... tried... but met it's fate by our righteous fury. The miniscule amount of griffons still doubting in Sickleclaw now have no reason to, for he is the one who brought us here."
SRS_revenge:0 "Revenge"
SRS_revenge_desc:0 "All the Imperial war criminals, both from this war and the counter-revolution that promted the march north, are to be tried and executed. Not in public, though, for Sickleclaw deems this act barbaric."

SRS_herzland_nobility_punishment_desc:0 "The appendix of griffon society is finally about to be brought to the end it richly deserved. Just like in Vedina, the scum will be tried. If they come out as benevolent nobles like Gerlach of Feathisia, they get stripped of their titles and get freed, we'll let Boreas sort out the vile part of the nobility..."
SRS_herzland_clergy_punishment:0 "The Reformation of the Clergy"
SRS_herzland_clergy_punishment_desc:0 "We can't just get rid of the clergy without inciting an uprising. Therefore, we will reform it. Eros, Erion and Proteus will be replaced by more... loyal religious citizens."

SRS_serf_emancipation:0 "The Proclamation of Serf Emancipation"
SRS_serf_emancipation_desc:0 "The serfs of old now own the land they toiled on for generations, and not the vile noble who demanded rent on top of the regular Imperial tax. The countryside will grow to be more acceptable to our rule over time."
SRS_land_redistribution:0 "Land Redistribution"
SRS_land_redistribution_desc:0 "The land previously owned by private entrepeneurs of noble and... disloyal citizens of monetarily privileged birth will be collectivized. No exceptions, if one puts up resistance, torch it all on fire."

SRS_gulag_industrialists:0 "Punish the Industrialists"
SRS_gulag_industrialists_desc:0 "As much as it hurts to say this, the former industrialists will be treated in the same way the former nobility is. The worst get the noose as the decent try to reform themselves in a brave new world under our watchful eyes."
SRS_protecc_the_worker:0 "Protect the Worker"
SRS_protecc_the_worker_desc:0 "The average worker up north in New Skynavia has a more comfortable work enviroment than the average Herzlander worker. The aforementioned Herzlander worker will get to know work, with zero risk of losing wings to machinery."

SRS_unite_griffonkind_desc:0 "Our job isn't done yet. We cannot sit in Griffenheim while half of Griffonkind is under oppressive regimes. Sickleclaw will lead us through the hardships of war once again, for a brighter future, where everygriff is free to pursue their dream."

SRS_warplan_rice:0 "Warplan Rice"
SRS_warplan_rice_desc:0 "Warplan "Rice" is the plan concerning the annexation of dissident states in the Evi valley. Nogriff really had any name for this warplan, so the generalstaff just code-named it "Rice" and called it a day." 
SRS_all_is_well:0 "All is Well"
SRS_all_is_well_desc:0 ""If you want something done right, do it yourself!" - That was essentially Sickleclaw's life motto. Now that he had done what would be botched under the General Congress, maybe it's time to enjoy the fruits of his labour, like a true worker should."
SRS_state_of_the_army:0 "The State of the Army"
SRS_state_of_the_army_desc:0 "After the civil war, many former anti-sickleclaw militants were given amnesty. Some joined the army in efforts to destroy it from within. Fortunately there are no democratic processes concering kicking disloyal members out for treason ever since the founding of Sickleclaw's militias themselves back in the '80s"
SRS_officer_purge_1:0 "Captains and Lieutenants..."
SRS_officer_purge_1_desc:0 "One of the most regrettable things for Sickleclaw, is that even some platoon and company commanders are pro-congress, but haven't rebelled against Sickleclaw for unknown reasons. Now that they have new friends in the rank and file, we must audit them all."
SRS_officer_purge_2:0 "...Ensigns and Sergeants"
SRS_officer_purge_2_desc:0 "The problem we noticed after auditing and promptly purging disloyal commissioned officers, we found out that... the problem is huge. Now, non-commissioned officers are to be audited as well."

SRS_new_chain_of_command:0 "Reform the Chain of Command"
SRS_new_chain_of_command_desc:0 "What Sickleclaw was taught in a military academy is not compatible for today's battlefields. Highly-portable artillery pieces, one-creature operated automatic weaponry and many other innovations are more useful when left with a degree of autonomy in the field of battle."
SRS_gas_gas_gas:0 "Gas! Gas! Gas!"
SRS_gas_gas_gas_desc:0 "The enemy might use some rather nasty things against us, using the old "communists aren't people!" excuse... If it comes to that, Sickleclaw would personally destroy hundreds of respiratory systems at one push of a button."
SRS_new_talent:0 "New Talent"
SRS_new_talent_desc:0 "There are quite a lot of "armchair generals" within our borders. Maybe, if we hear some out, we could get some insight on what to do to improve our armed forces. We could also snatch an extra general or two, since the generalstaff hasn't gotten some "fresh blood" in years."
SRS_mobile_warfare:0 "Cult of Motorization"
SRS_mobile_warfare_desc:0 "Motor vehicles, like trucks, are widely adaptable to military use, and don't require heavy and expensive armour plating like tanks. This could be expolited in order to create what is essentially an army on wheels."
SRS_sickleclaws_tankies:0 "Birth of Skynavian Armour"
SRS_sickleclaws_tankies_desc:0 "It is well known that Skynavia attracted many experts from all fields of science persecuted for their beliefs in socialism, and our land is rich in resources. If we put our back into it, we can make a Skynavian armoured vehicle industry a real thing."
SRS_sickleclaws_shinier_tankies:0 "Sickleclaw's Insight"
SRS_sickleclaws_shinier_tankies_desc:0 "Sickleclaw is fascinated by tanks. So much so, that he is in the position to give advice for new designs. Just keep him away from the people who advocated for one-creature turrets, for the love of Boreas..."

SRS_tankbusters:0 "Tank-Busters"
SRS_tankbusters_desc:0 "The Severyanan revolution proved that even some tractors with armour plating are able to punch a hole through a line, given the soldiers aren't properly equipped for destroying these machines. Resources shall be diverted in order to help development of such weapons."
SRS_medicine:0 "Medicine"
SRS_medicine_desc:0 "Charging into combat knowing that even flesh wounds are fatal is not so great for morale. Every soldier shall know how to administer basic first aid, to keep the wounded soldier alive until they reach an aid station."
SRS_every_griffon_a_soldier:0 "Drecreased Recruitment Standards"
SRS_every_griffon_a_soldier_desc:0 "We can't be too picky with our recruits, for the strategic-oriented mindset of the high command requires strength in numbers. Our army might lose some prestige, but we really can't manage any other way."
SRS_winter_training:0 "Winter Training"
SRS_winter_training_desc:0 "The Skynavian winter - Only a widow's heart is colder. Luckily, we have a million creatures who are used to it. Their knowledge will be used to help the comrades who live further down south to bear with the cold much better."
SRS_relentless_assault:0 "Relentless Assault"
SRS_relentless_assault_desc:0 ""The Imperial might question us : "Why are we still attacking after losing thousands?". To that we shall respond: "You retreat after losing a thousand troops? are you that weak?""
SRS_experimental_warfare:0 "Experimental Warfare"
SRS_experimental_warfare_desc:0 "We must improvise - our recruitment pool is too miniscule for a grand strategic-oriented doctrine, and our war machine is too small for mass prodction of vehicles. Instead, we will have our own... amalgamation of a doctrine. We sincerely hope it works."
SRS_magic_guns:0 "Magic Guns"
SRS_magic_guns_desc:0 "A bored militagriff somewhere in the Littlegriff mountain range shoved a magic crystal up the barrel in their rifle, loaded a round, and pulled the trigger. Surprisingly, it didn't blow up, instead it fired a magical ray that, upon further investion, can pierce fifteen to twenty milimeters of steel plate. When the bored soul was asked how does it work, he merely answered "Hey, it's magic! I ain't gotta explain shit!""

SRS_rocket_artillery:0 "Rocket Artillery"
SRS_rocket_artillery_desc:0 "A regular artillery piece fires one shell. For the same production cost, an multiple-rocket launch system can fire oh-dozens of projectiles. If this isn't cost-effectiveness, then I don't know what it is."
SRS_use_radio:0 "Utilization of the Radio"
SRS_use_radio_desc:0 "Wireless communications are the future, and military use of wireless field telephones will bolster interest in further research. Soon enough, Skynavia would become five years in front of Griffenheim for all we know."

SRS_superheavy_tanks_xdxdxd_desc:0 "We are not allowed to confirm nor deny the existence of "Project Acturius"."
SRS_harness_crystal_energy:0 "Harness the Crystal"
SRS_harness_crystal_energy_desc:0 "It is common knowledge that some magic crystals can be used to... forgive my Aquileian, blow shit up. There could be a possibility of a bomb with an undescribable yield, able to wipe out entire cities in one go. Why not be the first one to field a weapon that can destroy the world?"
SRS_rocketry:0 "Rocketry"
SRS_rocketry_desc:0 "Imagine hitting a target anywhere on the face of Griffonia, from Skynavia to, let's say... Kivessin. Horrifying, right? That's why even peace-loving people want this, to prevent war by hypothetical gunpoint. Upon the unveiling of such a weapon, we might have peace in our time..."

These delegates, who are subject to immediate recall and replacement from their communities, serve on the Congress for a term limited to three election cycles, after which they must step down — that is, if they have managed to retain their position for the three consecutive cycles, which hardly happens.\n\nThe outcome of the elections are mainly based on the decisions of the Internationalists and Communalists in between elections, where over-eager and too-frequent decision-making by either faction alienates those citizens of Skynavia most adversely affected by such decisions, thus loosing them their support.\n\nIt is very rare that either faction secures an overwhelming majority within the General Congress, as various checks and balances serve to maintain a stable power balance where no faction is able to permanently wield veto power over the Congress — such a situation would be quite undemocratic."
