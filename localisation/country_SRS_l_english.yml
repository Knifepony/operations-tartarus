#### LEADERS ####
JOHN_CARLINI_NAME_DESC:0 "John Carlini grew up in a rich merchant district in Skyfall, experiencing a pampered childhood provided by his businessgriff father.\n\nGoing to the Cyrusval University in Yale for his higher studies, he became radicalised by the socialist thought prevalent in the University's Faculty of Social Sciences. Thoroughly disillusioned with his bourgeois upbringing, as soon as he graduated he signed up to one of the many mercenary companies fighting in the conflicts flaring up all around the world.\n\nHaving participated in the fierce fighting in the fields of Prywhen on the Communist side, Carlini arrived at the Socialist Republic of Skynavia bringing with him those of his mercenary company he was able to win over to the ideals of socialism. Now, he aspires to fight for a higher cause - that of the liberation of the proletariat of Griffonia."
SICKLECLAW_NAME_DESC:0 "Asper Sickleclaw was a junior lieutenant in the Griffonian army when the First Revolution smashed the Empire to pieces. Marching alongside his fellow revolutionaries, Sickleclaw participated in most of the battles against the monarchist counter-revolution, eventually ending up in Cloudbury along with the remnants of the Republican government.\n\nHaving witnessed the despotism and authoritarianism of the Republican generals, Sickleclaw, anticipating the Republic's spiral into warlordism, adopted socialist views and marched onwards north, leading disillusioned socialists and other leftists away from the crumbling Republic into the virgin lands of Skynavia, where they hoped to start anew, free from the baggage of capitalist militarism.\n\nNow a staunch Internationalist, Sickleclaw is the foremost military leader of the Skynavian Socialist Republic, and is looked up to by most as a revered war hero, though some have raised concerns over what they perceive to be autocratic tendencies in his leadership."
GRANGER_NAME_DESC:0 "An aspiring officer cadet of the Imperial Guard in his youth, Granger turned his back on all the riches of the Griffonian Empire, choosing instead to put his expertise at the service the socialist revolution.\n\nAs with most military leaders in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, Granger is an avowed Internationalist, as well as being a close friend and ideological ally of Field Marshal Sickleclaw."
HORSON_WELLES_NAME_DESC:0 "Horson Welles began his illustrious career as a socialist revolutionary in his native Equestria, where in his early adulthood he produced numerous groundbreaking films equally revered for their avant-garde creativity and progressive values.\n\nLater he travelled across the ocean to the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, where he could experience and document the griffons' revolutionary struggle firsthoof.\n\nIn his youth, Horson took part in many shooting competitions, and got very good at marksponyship."

#### IDEAS ####
SRS_young_chick:0 "Emilia Stalwart"
SRS_young_chick_desc:0 "Born to a pair of determined socialist revolutionaries from the Heartlands, Emilia Stalwart was only a child when the Socialist Republic of Skynavia was established. Having experienced an education couched in socialist ideology, Emilia nevertheless was not satisfied with her life in Skynavia, instead choosing to go visit the capitalist countries of the south when she graduated.\n\nHaving experienced firstclaw the depredations of capitalism, authoritarianism, and monarchism during her travels, she has now returned to her home an ardent internationalist, carrying within her an immutable resolve to change the world for the better."

This system is democratic and open, and ensures that no individual, clique, or political faction is able to dominate Skynavian politics.\n\nThe ever-changing makeup of the Congress, and the lack of political acumen of its delegates, means that Congressional proceedings are oftentimes circuitous, as every motion and proposal is scrutinised and discussed exhaustively. This is viewed as an acceptable price to pay for the democracy and liberty of the Skynavian people."

SRS_civwar_battle_3:0 "Up the Littlegriff"
SRS_civwar_battle_3_desc:0 "Mountain warfare is quite a grueling ordeal. While Sickleclaw's regular formations are duking it out with the mostly untrained pro-Congress forces, the bulk of Sickleclaw's elite will be delegated to rooting out resistance in the Littlegriff mountain range."
SRS_civwar_battle_4:0 "The City is Ours!"
SRS_civwar_battle_4_desc:0 "The pro-Sickleclaw forces are now to head into the city. It will be painful for Asper to see the city in such a state of disrepair due to the urban skirmishes, but it is neccessary for Skynavia to survive as a socialist nation."

SRS_rev_mil_soviet:0 "Ratify the Sickleclaw Constitution"
SRS_rev_mil_soviet_desc:0 "The Sickleclaw Constitution of 1007 strips Sickleclaw of powers most dictators would defend with their very lives.

SRS_defend_the_revolution:0 "In the Defense of the Revolution"
SRS_defend_the_revolution_desc:0 "We cannot let the evil capitalists crush our revolution, not in battle, nor in the "Unsichtbaren Front". As much as it hurts the core libertarian values of the Skyanvian citizen, an intelligence service must be established, for our own good."

SRS_avenge_986_desc:0 "The 986 Act For The Salvation Of The Republic, giving Kemerskai an underclawed victory against Sickleclaw, was the catalyst for the second march north. Now, we shall rid the Cloudburian people from their woes honourably. The Republican authority in Cloudbury has been delcared an illegitimate state, and war is inevitable."
SRS_ntrwar_commie:0 "The Delayed Pacification"
SRS_ntrwar_commie_desc:0 "First step towards breaking the siege is pacifying the tribes who are currently hostile towards us. With them out of the picture, we can srike our southern neighbours while their guard is down."
SRS_far_north_republic:0 "The Far Northern Republic"
SRS_far_north_republic_desc:0 "There is no doubt that we are to face furious resistance in the event of annexation of tribal territory. Therefore, we shall establish the Far Northern Republic, a native rule government, in total obedience to us. Of course, no consctruction projects will take place within the territory of the FNR, to respect the anti-modernity sentiment of the local populace."
SRS_commie_yeetvedina:0 "The End of an Era"
SRS_commie_yeetvedina_desc:0 "Feudalism is one of the greatest evils our revolution has to face. Despite harmonic ideals, the Vedinian system hasn't changed for the entire existence of the Kingdom.

SRS_north_united:0 "The Crimson North"
SRS_north_united_desc:0 "What Kemerskai, nor the decentralized commune of old hadn't been able to accomplish has been, well, just made a reality by comrade Sickleclaw. Uniting the north is just the beginning, though..."
SRS_conscription_reform:0 "Recruitment Policy Reform"

SRS_economic_reform:0 "Socialist Economic Reform"
SRS_economic_reform_desc:0 "We must make an effort to help the ailing people of Vedina and Cloudbury to recover from their barbaric economic policies that favour the privileged classes. Only then we shall expect to compete with the somehow-recovering Empire."
SRS_education_reform:0 "Socialst Education Reform"
SRS_education_reform_desc:0 "The "Harmonic" despots of Vedina have made an effort to keep the people illiterate to keep them in feudal bondage.

SRS_kemerskai_fate:0 "Kemerskai's Fate"
SRS_kemerskai_fate_desc:0 "Traitors always reap what the sow, and Kemerskai is not an exception. The Revolutionary Miliatry Council shall debate on what to do with that rat."
SRS_commie_yeetbrantbeak:0 "Pacify the Mountains"
SRS_commie_yeetbrantbeak_desc:0 "In the mountainous north, there is not a richer mountain range than Brantbeak. By taking it, we would deny capitalists resources, and secure our eastern flank from potential Imperial onslaught."

SRS_rejoin_kemerskai_gang_desc:0 "Despite disagreements in the past, Sickleclaw and Kemerskai are, despite unwilling to trust each other at the moment, willing to co-operate against the empire.

SRS_bend_the_knee:0 "Bend the Knee"
SRS_bend_the_knee_desc:0 "We have recieved a list of demands that would humiliate Sickleclaw's government. Some believe it's a consipracy to divide Skynavia, and let Kemerskai pick up the pieces and erase our communist legacy with ease. We're to prove him wrong, of course."
SRS_republican_dream:0 "The Socialist Republican Dream"
SRS_republican_dream_desc:0 "A capitalist Republic can only lead to an oligarchy and fascism, which is the last-ditch effort of the capitalist to prevent the righteous liberation of their capital by the people. Can a honest working griff really call that a dream?"
SRS_moderate_backlash:0 "Moderate Backlash"
SRS_moderate_backlash_desc:0 "The Skynavian moderates, their equivalents - a loud minority in most nations, is the average first-generation settler here. They should be made to know that the deed of allying with the Republican movement is a mere act of pragmatism, and should remain skeptical of the integrity of the Cloudbury Republican Movement, while accepting them as a temproary ally against the resurgent Empire."
SRS_radical_backlash:0 "Radical Backlash"
SRS_radical_backlash_desc:0 "The Skynavian radicals, also called "The Wild Bunch" by their moderate comrades, are expressing their genuine dissapointment in Sickleclaw's government. Sickleclaw must make them know that their protesting is exactly what Kemerskai wanted with his demands."

SRS_congress_two_boogaloo_desc:0 "The first demand from Cloudbury: the formation of the Skynavian Republican Congress, undoing the planned Sickleclaw constitution drafted during the civil war. This was quite possibly meant to cripple Sickleclaw's power as the legitimate leader of Skynavia."
SRS_republican_propaganda:0 ""Republican" Propaganda"
SRS_republican_propaganda_desc:0 "As per the second demand: we are to make our people think that Skynavia will be loyal to the Republican struggle, finish the three decade period of strife in Griffonia. Of course, we can twist the narrative to unite the people, rather than stoke them for the war that will just let Kemerskai exterminate us in the anti-Imperial war to come with deliberately botched engagements."
SRS_together_against_monarchy:0 "Together Against Monarchy"
SRS_together_against_monarchy_desc:0 "A dozen privileged griffons of noble birth indulging in debauchery, while a thousand more toil to supply that debauchery is truly a gross sight. But, in capitalism, that is also the reality well-hidden by Kemerskai's propaganda machine. Only socialism will put an end to the double standards of the Republican movement."
SRS_reforge_enthusiasm:0 "Reforge Enthusiasm"

SRS_approach_the_tribes_desc:0 "Our march north was depicted as a brutal conquest of a peaceful tribal region by the Cloudburian reactionaries. If we are to gain the support of the people, we should look to peacefully resolve the conflict with the tribesponies."

SRS_meet_with_waifu_desc:0 "After our pony diplomats somehow managed to break the language barrier and negotiated for a cease-fire, it is time for Sickleclaw to personally shake claw and hoof with the leader, Princess Fiana II. It will be a very... interesting encounter to say the least."

SRS_speak_herzlander_desc:0 "The "Speak Herzlander" program is to make Herzlander an universal language understood at an rudimentary level by every citizen, without alienating the native tongues of non-herzlander citizens.

SRS_warplans:0 "Warplans"
SRS_warplans_desc:0 "Our army isn't a collection of ill-standardized militias anymore. It is akin to Sickleclaw's militia brigades before the power-grab - standardized, uniformed and trained.

SRS_monarchists_be_gone:0 "Solidarity with the Vedinian People"
SRS_monarchists_be_gone_desc:0 "The un-educated masses of Vedina don't care who is the tax collector, 'tis the harsh truth.

SRS_unfinished_urban_projects_desc:0 "It's the same story every time: internationalists want to build a centralized factory, it gets finished half-way, then the communalists go ahead and stall the project, letting the unfinished factory take up the little space we have.

SRS_military_industry_focus:0 "Arsenal of Socialism"

SRS_libtard_economics:0 "A Market Economy"
SRS_libtard_economics_desc:0 "As we're rejoining the Republican cause, we should strive to improve our economy via the free market. We can't go around making Skynavia a capitalist paradise overnight, though, so a market socialist economy will do just fine."

srs_sickoflavour.1.d:0 "There stood New Skynavia, the city on top of the Griffonian continent and the bastion of libertarian socialism worldwide - the most idyllic reconscruction of Marksist society, the home of the revolutionaries disillusioned with the Republican movement in Cloudbury.\n\nIt is also the beating heart of the indiscriminate crusade of the working class against the forces of reaction - capitalism, monarchism, imperialism and tribalism - that by irony of fate surrounded the two-decade old experimental "state". Every citizen is a firm and unwavering follower of socialist ideology, but are certainly not united...\n\n"Nonsense, I tell you!" - An internationalist griffon bawked, his cries filling up the indoors of a city pub - "War, even if it represents a short-time hinderance, is the only way to effectively fight our enemies!"   His debate partner, a communalist mare fired back: "It is foolish to expand while many of the creatures we already incorporated into the revolution stay behind technologically and culturally!"   And so she continued: "Even if we quickly quadrupled the size of our nation, we'd stay nonetheless an underdeveloped nation that needs concentration both by education and technological advances."\n\nThe disagreement went on and on, but in the end the only solution that found common ground was the griffon that drunkenly said that both of them were certified "MOR-ons!"".

A big risk! A risk so dangerous that it inspires the same griffon who risked it all for your country's independence to silently, but actively conspire against your form of government!\n\nAs rumours of Sickleclaw's increased distress caused by political infighting between the two sects of socialism spread all across the city, he is believed to have started giving private speeches about the incopetence of the congressional governmental system during wartime to his soldiers, colleagues and his ideological bretheren - fellow internationalists.\n\nIt seems like the old revolutionary still has the liberation of Griffenheim as a persistent thought on his mind. While some daydream about the liberation of the Herzlandisch working class from the tyrannical claws of the Kaiser and the nobility, some share genuine worries about a fall to totalitarianism."

Under cover of darkness, a platoon of pro-Congress militiagriffs fired at roughly two hundred pro-Sickleclaw troops guarding the tribal frontier weapons cache in Ostfloy.\n\nAt about 2300 hours, thirty pro-Congress troops positioned North of the cache fired a scoffed volley towards the pickets. The two pro-Sickleclaw companies reportedly fired at each other as well as their attackers. The black powder weaponry used by both sides, but less prominently by the pro-Sickleclaw side, made it possible for the pickets to quickly return fire, wounding two ambushers./n/nThe pro-Sickleclaw forces suffered one killed and one wounded during the firefight, and their numerical advantage prevented the attackers to effectively disrupt the evacuvation of the Ostfloy cache to Braunles. Ultimately, the evacuvation of the cache was successful, and gave Sickleclaw an advantage in firepower over his opposition throughout the civil war."

SRS_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "In 1002, Asper Sickleclaw encouraged an ultimately successful project to convert the stockpiles of Vorderlader Model 70 muzzle-loader rifles into breech-loading rifles en-masse with relative ease. The refurbished rifles fired a 13x71mm black powder cartridge, and had the stopping power required to knock a tribal warrior to the ground with ease. It quickly became a symbol of the war against the tribes, with many post-bellum film appearences."
