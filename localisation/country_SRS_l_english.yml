#### LEADERS ####
JOHN_CARLINI_NAME_DESC:0 "John Carlini grew up in a rich merchant district in Skyfall, experiencing a pampered childhood provided by his businessgriff father.\n\nGoing to the Cyrusval University in Yale for his higher studies, he became radicalised by the socialist thought prevalent in the University's Faculty of Social Sciences. Thoroughly disillusioned with his bourgeois upbringing, as soon as he graduated he signed up to one of the many mercenary companies fighting in the conflicts flaring up all around the world.\n\nHaving participated in the fierce fighting in the fields of Prywhen on the Communist side, Carlini arrived at the Socialist Republic of Skynavia bringing with him those of his mercenary company he was able to win over to the ideals of socialism. Now, he aspires to fight for a higher cause - that of the liberation of the proletariat of Griffonia."
SICKLECLAW_NAME_DESC:0 "Asper Sickleclaw was a junior lieutenant in the Griffonian army when the First Revolution smashed the Empire to pieces. Marching alongside his fellow revolutionaries, Sickleclaw participated in most of the battles against the monarchist counter-revolution, eventually ending up in Cloudbury along with the remnants of the Republican government.\n\nHaving witnessed the despotism and authoritarianism of the Republican generals, Sickleclaw, anticipating the Republic's spiral into warlordism, adopted socialist views and marched onwards north, leading disillusioned socialists and other leftists away from the crumbling Republic into the virgin lands of Skynavia, where they hoped to start anew, free from the baggage of capitalist militarism.\n\nNow a staunch Internationalist, Sickleclaw is the foremost military leader of the Skynavian Socialist Republic, and is looked up to by most as a revered war hero, though some have raised concerns over what they perceive to be autocratic tendencies in his leadership."
GRANGER_NAME_DESC:0 "An aspiring officer cadet of the Imperial Guard in his youth, Granger turned his back on all the riches of the Griffonian Empire, choosing instead to put his expertise at the service the socialist revolution.\n\nAs with most military leaders in the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, Granger is an avowed Internationalist, as well as being a close friend and ideological ally of Field Marshal Sickleclaw."
HORSON_WELLES_NAME_DESC:0 "Horson Welles began his illustrious career as a socialist revolutionary in his native Equestria, where in his early adulthood he produced numerous groundbreaking films equally revered for their avant-garde creativity and progressive values.\n\nLater he travelled across the ocean to the Socialist Republic of Skynavia, where he could experience and document the griffons' revolutionary struggle firsthoof.\n\nIn his youth, Horson took part in many shooting competitions, and got very good at marksponyship."

#### IDEAS ####
SRS_young_chick:0 "Emilia Stalwart"
SRS_young_chick_desc:0 "Born to a pair of determined socialist revolutionaries from the Heartlands, Emilia Stalwart was only a child when the Socialist Republic of Skynavia was established. Having experienced an education couched in socialist ideology, Emilia nevertheless was not satisfied with her life in Skynavia, instead choosing to go visit the capitalist countries of the south when she graduated.\n\nHaving experienced firstclaw the depredations of capitalism, authoritarianism, and monarchism during her travels, she has now returned to her home an ardent internationalist, carrying within her an immutable resolve to change the world for the better."

This system is democratic and open, and ensures that no individual, clique, or political faction is able to dominate Skynavian politics.\n\nThe ever-changing makeup of the Congress, and the lack of political acumen of its delegates, means that Congressional proceedings are oftentimes circuitous, as every motion and proposal is scrutinised and discussed exhaustively.

SRS_civwar_battle_2_desc:0 "Sickleclaw's army isn't the only force fighting for the "toppling" of the congress. Many skirmishes between pro-Sickleclaw and pro-Congress militias occured during the civil war in and around the city, albeit those more resembled the situation in Fezera than an actual war."
SRS_civwar_battle_3:0 "Up the Littlegriff"
SRS_civwar_battle_3_desc:0 "Mountain warfare is quite a grueling ordeal. While Sickleclaw's regular formations are duking it out with the mostly untrained pro-Congress forces, the bulk of Sickleclaw's elite will be delegated to rooting out resistance in the Littlegriff mountain range."
SRS_civwar_battle_4:0 "The City is Ours!"
SRS_civwar_battle_4_desc:0 "The pro-Sickleclaw forces are now to head into the city. It will be painful for Asper to see the city in such a state of disrepair due to the urban skirmishes, but it is neccessary for Skynavia to survive as a socialist nation."

SRS_rev_mil_soviet_desc:0 "The Sickleclaw Constitution of 1007 strips Sickleclaw of powers most dictators would defend with their very lives.

srs_sickoflavour.1.t:0 "A Civil Disagreement"
srs_sickoflavour.1.d:0 "There stood New Skynavia, the city on top of the Griffonian continent and the bastion of libertarian socialism worldwide - the most idyllic reconscruction of Marksist society, the home of the revolutionaries disillusioned with the Republican movement in Cloudbury.\n\nIt is also the beating heart of the indiscriminate crusade of the working class against the forces of reaction - capitalism, monarchism, imperialism and tribalism - that by irony of fate surrounded the two-decade old experimental "state". Every citizen is a firm and unwavering follower of socialist ideology, but are certainly not united...\n\n"Nonsense, I tell you!" - An internationalist griffon bawked, his cries filling up the indoors of a city pub - "War, even if it represents a short-time hinderance, is the only way to effectively fight our enemies!"   His debate partner, a communalist mare fired back: "It is foolish to expand while many of the creatures we already incorporated into the revolution stay behind technologically and culturally!"   And so she continued: "Even if we quickly quadrupled the size of our nation, we'd stay nonetheless an underdeveloped nation that needs concentration both by education and technological advances."\n\nThe disagreement went on and on, but in the end the only solution that found common ground was the griffon that drunkenly said that both of them were certified "MOR-ons!"".

A big risk! A risk so dangerous that it inspires the same griffon who risked it all for your country's independence to silently, but actively conspire against your form of government!\n\nAs rumours of Sickleclaw's increased distress caused by political infighting between the two sects of socialism spread all across the city, he is believed to have started giving private speeches about the incopetence of the congressional governmental system during wartime to his soldiers, colleagues and his ideological bretheren - fellow internationalists.\n\nIt seems like the old revolutionary still has the liberation of Griffenheim as a persistent thought on his mind. While some daydream about the liberation of the Herzlandisch working class from the tyrannical claws of the Kaiser and the nobility, some share genuine worries about a fall to totalitarianism."

srs_sickocivwar.2.d:0 "The shootout in Ostfloy was the first armed confrontation in the Skynavian Civil War, only three weeks before Sickleclaw's proclaimation. Under cover of darkness, a platoon of pro-Congress militiagriffs fired at roughly two hundred pro-Sickleclaw troops guarding the tribal frontier weapons cache in Ostfloy.\n\nAt about 2300 hours, thirty pro-Congress troops positioned North of the cache fired a scoffed volley towards the pickets. The two pro-Sickleclaw companies reportedly fired at each other as well as their attackers. The black powder weaponry used by both sides, but less prominently by the pro-Sickleclaw side, made it possible for the pickets to quickly return fire, wounding two ambushers.\n\nThe pro-Sickleclaw forces suffered one killed and one wounded during the firefight, and their numerical advantage prevented the attackers to effectively disrupt the evacuvation of the Ostfloy cache to Braunles. Ultimately, the evacuvation of the cache was successful, and gave Sickleclaw an advantage in firepower over his opposition throughout the civil war."
