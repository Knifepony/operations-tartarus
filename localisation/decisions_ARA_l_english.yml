 ARA_arantigans_abroad:0 "Arantigans Abroad"
 ARA_arantigans_abroad_desc:0 "Centuries ago, Arantigos led his mighty army to conquer all of Griffonia. He died before was able to realise his dream, and his empire collapsed soon after his death. Arantigans have no forgotten their legacy, and we were, and still are, famed for our martial traditions. There are plenty of mercenary companies composed of Arantigans, their descendants or groups of griffons who have not forgotten their heritage and who are willing to return to their ancestral homeland to reclaim its former glory..."
 ARA_last_legion:0 "Hire the Karthin Legion"
 ARA_last_legion_desc:0 "The so called 'Karthin Legion' claims to be the descended from the armies of the fallen Kingdom of Karthin, conquered by Wingbardians ages ago. There is little truth to this claim, but there is no doubt that the legion has existed for centuries and they are considered as one of the most battle-hardened companies in the whole of Griffonia."
 ARA_true_legion:0 "Hire the Romau Legion"
 ARA_true_legion_desc:0 "Romau was the northenmost city of the Arantigan Empire, founded as a border stronghold by Arantigos himself. Before it became the seat of the Eyrite Archonate, many citizens worshipped Arantigos-Boreas. Small groups of such believers still exist to this day, banding with the remnants of the Romau Legionnaires to form the 'Romau Legion' when Grover II sacked the city."
 ARA_francistrian_volunteers:0 "Recruit Francistrian Volunteers"
 ARA_francistrian_volunteers_desc:0 "In the days of Arantigan twilight, many of our people live in what is today Francistrian territory. With the rebirth of the Arantigan dream of greatness, many of these griffons will join our fight. They just need a little encouragement..."
 ARA_call_diaspora:0 "Recall the Diaspora"
 ARA_call_diaspora_desc:0 "Many native Arantigans live abroad in cities like Karthin, Griffenheim, and Manehattan. By organizing propaganda campaigns, perhaps we can encourage some of them to return and help us regain our former greatness..."
